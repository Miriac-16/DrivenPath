## Theory
The main theoretical notions for the chapter along with resources for self-paced learning.

### Big Data
#### Description
Big data refers to extremely large and diverse collections of structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data that continues to grow exponentially over time. These datasets are so huge and complex in volume, velocity, and variety, that traditional data management systems cannot store, process, and analyze them.

### Data Engineer
#### Description
A data engineer integrates, transforms, and consolidates data from various structured and unstructured data systems into structures that are suitable for building analytics solutions. The data engineer also helps design and support data pipelines and data stores that are high-performing, efficient, organized, and reliable, given a specific set of business requirements and constraints.

### Cloud Computing
#### Description
Cloud computing and associated solutions provide access through the web to computing resources and products, including development tools, business applications, compute services, data storage, and networking solutions. These cloud services are hosted at a software vendorâ€™s data center and managed by the cloud services provider or onsite at a customer's data center.

#### AWS
Access [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwlvW2BhDyARIsADnIe-IgwrWgVraM9DbxPuBhtXrzhDOv1RoLsFkd13_kZDe0KCPqFPb3rjAaAiKSEALw_wcB&trk=9ab5159b-247d-4917-a0ec-ec01d1af6bf9&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=Cj0KCQjwlvW2BhDyARIsADnIe-IgwrWgVraM9DbxPuBhtXrzhDOv1RoLsFkd13_kZDe0KCPqFPb3rjAaAiKSEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!645133561110!e!!g!!create%20aws%20account!19579657595!152087369744&all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all) page and press `Create a Free Account` button in center of the page.\
If you already have an account just press `Sign in to an existing AWS account`.\
You can follow instructions below or access [Create Your AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/guides/setup-environment/module-one/) and follow instruction from there.\
![AWS Free Tier](../media/image_1.1.PNG)

**Step 1 - Select credentials**\
1 - Enter an email address and an account name.\
Carefully consider which email address you want to use. If you are setting up for a personal account, we don't recommend using a work email address because you may change jobs at some point. Conversely, for business accounts, we recommend using an email alias that can be managed because the person setting up the account may, at some point, change roles or companies.\
2 - Select Verify email address.\
You will get a verification code in your email. Enter the verification code and choose Verify.
You will be redirected to a new screen where you will create your root user password.\
![Select credentials](../media/image_1.2.PNG)

**Step 2 - Add contact information**\
1 - Choose between a business or personal account.\
There is no difference in account type or functionality, but there is a difference in the type of information required to open the account for billing purposes.
For a business account, choose a phone number that is tied to the business and can be reached if the person setting up the account is not available.\
2 - Once you have selected the account type, fill out the contact information about the account.
Save these details in a safe place. If you ever lose access to the email or your two-factor authentication device, AWS Support can use these details to confirm your identity.\
3 - At the end of this form, please read through the terms of the AWS Customer Agreement and select the checkbox to accept them.\
4 - Choose Continue (step 2 of 5) to proceed to the next screen.\
![Add contact information](../media/image_1.3.PNG)

**Step 3 - Add a payment method**\
1 - Enter your Billing Information details.\
A small hold will be placed on the card, so the address must match what your financial institution has on file for you or your business.\
2 - Select Verify and Continue (step 3 of 5) to proceed.\
![Add a payment method](../media/image_1.4.PNG)

**Step 4 - Confirm your identity**\
1 - Choose how you want to confirm your identity.\ 
You can verify your account either through a text message (SMS) or a voice call on the number you are associating with this account.
For the text message (SMS) option, you will be sent a numeric code to enter on the next screen after you choose Send SMS. 
For the Voice call option, you will be shown a code on the screen to enter after being prompted by the automated voice verification system.\
2 - Enter the code as appropriate for your verification choice, then choose Continue to proceed to the final step.\
![Confirm your identity](../media/image_1.5.PNG)

**Step 5 - Select a support plan**\
1 - Choose a support plan. For this tutorial, we recommend the default selection.\
You have three options for support plans. The default option is called Basic Support and is free of charge. If you are not sure, select Basic Support. You can always change support tiers at a later date. 
To see the full list of differences between the tiers, see Compare AWS Support Plans.\
2 - To finish creating your account, choose Complete sign up.\
![Select a support plan](../media/image_1.6.PNG)

Your account is now set up and being activated. When activation is complete, you will receive an email from AWS. Use the credentials you created in this module to log in to your root account.

#### GitHub
Access [GitHub](https://github.com/) page and press `Sign up` button in right corner of the page.\
If you already have an account just press `Sign  in` and login using existing credentials.\
You can follow instructions below or access [Creating an account on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) and follow instruction from there.\
![GitHub account](../media/image_1.7.PNG)

**Step 1 - Select credentials**\
Provide an email address that is not use for another GitHub account.\
Create a strong password that contains minimum 8 characters and strong enough to pass the verification from GitHub.\
Provide a username for your account.\
Choose the option for receive announcements from GitHub.\
![Select credentials](../media/image_1.8.PNG)

**Step 2 - Pass verification**\
Solve three puzzles in order to check that you're a human.
![Pass verification](../media/image_1.9.PNG)

**Step 3 - Confirm email address**\
We'll receive an 8-digit code from GitHub on your email address that you used for account setup. Copy the code in current page.
![Confirm email address](../media/image_1.10.PNG)

**Step 4 - Choose you plan**\
Choose the plan for your account. For your personal use the free account is always enough. Press `Continue for free`.
